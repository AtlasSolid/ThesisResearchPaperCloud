# ThesisResearchPaperCloud
An analytical research paper on the history and possible future of cloud computing. Looking to answer the question of whether cloud computing's relevancy in modern-day society is set to increase or decrease in the future.


Important topics to cover:

Cloud computing is a difficult concept to understand. Explain it in a way that laypeople can get.

Cover the history of its development and applications. Emphasize how much it's evolved and how invaluable it's become nowadays.

Gather information and future "predictions" from reputable sources: Third-party groups, non-profit foundations, people currently working in the industry (employees at Amazon AWS, Google, etc. Mahoney will help provide these people)

Take all perspectives into account. Base your conclusion off of what trustrworthy sources are theorizing.


Update: working on structuring the outline of paper.

Outline:

Introduction, possibly outline goals?

Explanation of Cloud computing

History of cloud computing


Transition into speculation about Future

Interview with AWS/cloud company employees

Interview with Corey Quinn if at all possible


Transition from Corey's viewpoint into potential concerns about Future

(if Corey is unavailable, dedicate section to LastWeekInAWS' viewpoints)

Discuss articles showing the current issues with cloud computing

Contrast with sources talking about the positives


Synthesis

Go through your thought process

Logically develop a conclusion based on what you've previously covered



Questions for interviewees:
  * What got you into the cloud business in the first place? Is it just something that particularly interests you, or would you       say you got into this field because it's in such high demand nowadays?
  * Has your opinion on it changed or evolved over time?
  * There have been talks about a new "cloud repatriation" movement going on, mainly due to concerns about increasing maintenance     costs and potential security risks. What is your opinion on this? Do you think these concerns are valid, or not something      to be particularly concerned about?
  * (if response to last question indicates subject is pro-cloud computing) What are your hopes for the future of the cloud? Do       you see any new potential implementations or expansions of this service on the horizon? Would you recommend that aspiring         software design students get into this field?
  * (if pro-cloud repatriation) Do you think the cloud repatration movement is indicative of anything in terms of the cloud's         future? How much do you speculate this will affect the field in terms of market viability or importance within computing as a     whole? Is there a chance to recover, or do you think that the cloud is officially past its heyday?
